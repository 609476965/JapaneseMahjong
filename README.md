# JapaneseMahjong
A Japanese Mahjong demo created in Unity 5.3.4 (Demo Completed).

Special thanks to the source-opened Andjong, I translated all the java(Android) codes to C# and refactored most of them.

As all the texture and sound resources were downloaded from internet, DON'T use this project in any commercial purpose!
